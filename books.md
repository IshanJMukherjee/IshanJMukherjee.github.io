Yes, I will make a New Year's resolution. If that isn't clichÃ©d enough, I am making one about reading one book every week. And in the style of [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/book) and [Nat Eliason](https://www.nateliason.com/notes), I will upload short notes and summaries of every book I read, perhaps even reviews of those I like (or disagree with).

Right now, I am reading _Good Economics for Hard Times_ by Esther Duflo and Abhijit V. Banerjee. These are a few books I plan to read soon:

1. _Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers and Strategies_ by Nick Bostrom
2. _Global Catastrophic Risks_ by Nick Bostrom and Milan M. Ä†irkoviÄ‡
3. _1984_ by George Orwell
4. _Animal Farm_ by George Orwell
5. _Midnight's Children_ by Salman Rushdie
6. _The Handmaid's Tale_ by Margaret Atwood
7. _The Undercover Economist Strikes Back_ by Tim Harford
8. _Enlightenment Now_ by Steven Pinker
9. _The Selfish Gene_ by Richard Dawkins
10. _Seveneves_ by Neal Stephenson
11. _Fahrenheit 451_ by Ray Bradbury
12. _Slaughterhouse Five_ by Kurt Vonnegut
13. _Flowers for Algernon_ by Daniel Keyes
