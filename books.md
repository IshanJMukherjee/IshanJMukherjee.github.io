## Okay, I'll bite
Yes, I will make a New Year's resolution. If that isn't clichéd enough, I will make one about reading one book every week. And in the style of [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/book) and [Nat Eliason](https://www.nateliason.com/notes), I will upload short notes and summaries of every book I read, perhaps even reviews of those I like (or disagree with).

Right now, I am reading _Good Economics for Hard Times_ by Esther Duflo and Abhijit V. Banerjee. These are a few books I plan to read soon:
